## Abstract

Rivers are often considered conduits for macrolitter pollution into the sea. However, freshwater ecosystems are
also themselves highly exposed to macrolitter detrimental effects, such as ingestion by local fauna. Long-term and large-scale
assessments on macrolitter on riverbanks and lake shores can provide an understanding of litter presence in freshwater systems,
notably in terms of abundance, composition and origin of items.
