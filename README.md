# Indentifying accumulation and leakage with Spearmans Rho

Data from a national beach litter survey of lakes and rivers is compared to landuse using Spearmans rank correlation coeffeicient. Spearmans Rho is easy to implement in python or a spreadsheet and may serve as an initial automated assessment for local administrations when considering the results of beach litter surveys.

The value of Rho is defined for all objects that reach a quantity threshold with landuse categories defined by the National Statistical Survey. The density of the objects was tested against each landuse category within a defined distance from the location of the survey. The operation is repeated for surveys 1.5km - 5km, every .5km and 10km.
